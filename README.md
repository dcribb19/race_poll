# Analysis of Jeff Gluck's "Was it a Good Race?" Poll
## A Streamlit App

Jeff Gluck (@jeff_gluck) has asked all of Twitter for
their honest opinions on the day after every NASCAR Cup Series
race since 2016. It's a very simple question really. "Was it a
good race?" There are only 2 answers (Yes/No), but people have
different criteria for what they consider to be a "good" race.
Was the decision based solely on the quality of the racing?
Did their favorite driver win? Did NASCAR make a questionable
officiating decision? Did the race go green until one late
caution that made for an exciting final restart(s)? Did an
unpopular driver win? As we can see, there are many factors that
can go into this 'Yes' or 'No' decision. Thankfully,
Jeff has saved all of the results in a table on his [website](https://jeffgluck.com) along with some additional information,
including: number of votes, winner, track type, day/night, and
time of race. So, I'm going analyze this data, try to make
some interesting interactive visualizations, then share them
through Streamlit.
